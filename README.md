# wg

wg is a neat little command line tool to manage git(hub|lab) projects locally.

It is inspired by [Jeff Dickey's gh tool](https://github.com/dickeyxxx/gh).

## Usage

`wg USER/REPO` will change the current shell's directory to `~/w/g/h/user/repo` if the repo already exists, or clone the repo there if it does not already exists.
